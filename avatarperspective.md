Avatar Perspective Analysis
What they would like:
The headline hits hard — "decoration" is relatable
Problem section resonates with their frustration
Clear pricing with no hidden fees
The guarantees sound good (if believable)
Fast timeline (14 days)
What they would dislike/find suspicious:
Tech jargon — "Next.js", "Tailwind", "Vercel", "SSL" means nothing to them
"12 sites launched" — Smells like BS. New companies don't have track records
"€0 if no leads in 30 days" — Too good to be true. Sounds like a trap
"Only 3 slots left" — Fake urgency they've seen 1000 times
No face behind the company — Who am I actually trusting my money with?
No real proof — No screenshots, no real client names, no before/after
Generic promises — Everyone says "conversion-focused"
What's missing:
Human presence — Who's behind this? A name, a face, a story
Honest positioning — "We're new, but obsessed with results" is more credible than fake numbers
Specific, tangible examples — What will MY website actually look like?
Believable risk reversal — Not vague promises, but specific commitments
Local relevance — Do you understand MY market?
Proof of expertise — If no clients yet, show your work/background
Plan: 8.5 → 10/10
Phase 1: Remove All Technical Jargon
Current problematic copy:
"Built with Next.js + Tailwind" → DELETE
"PageSpeed optimized" → "Loads in under 2 seconds"
"Vercel hosting" → "Fast hosting included"
"SSL included" → "Secure forms included" or DELETE
"Core Web Vitals optimized" → "Google-approved speed"
Files: app/page.tsx
Phase 2: Fix Dishonest/Suspicious Claims
Remove or reframe:
"12 sites launched this quarter" → Remove entirely
Replace with honest positioning: "New agency. Experienced team. Obsessed with results."
Or: "Founding member spots available" (honest about being new)
"€0 if no leads in 30 days" → Make specific and believable:
"No leads in 30 days? We revise until it works — free."
Or: "30-day results guarantee: If you don't get at least 1 qualified inquiry, we fix it free."
"Only 3 slots left this month" → Remove fake scarcity
Replace with: "We take on max 4 projects/month to ensure quality"
Or: "Currently accepting new clients"
"90+ PageSpeed guaranteed" → Keep but translate:
"Loads faster than 90% of websites" (more relatable)
Files: app/page.tsx, app/globals.css
Phase 3: Add Human Presence (Founder Section)
Add a "Who's Behind This" section before or after the "Why Us" section:
[Photo]"I started landyourweb because I saw too many small businesses get burned by agencies that delivered pretty designs but zero clients.I believe your website should pay for itself. If it doesn't, I haven't done my job."— [Name], Founder
Why this works:
Builds trust for a new company
Personal accountability
Shows you understand their pain (been burned by agencies)
Files: app/page.tsx, need to add a founder photo
Phase 4: Reframe Social Proof for a New Company
Current metrics strip: "12 Sites launched | 90+ PageSpeed | 14 Days | €0 if no leads"
New honest version:
Option A — Focus on commitments, not claims:
[14 Days]           [90%+ Speed]        [30-Day Guarantee]    [Cancel Anytime]Launch deadline     Faster than         Results or we         No lock-in                    competitors         fix it free           contracts
Option B — Honest "new but capable" messaging:
"New agency. Experienced team. Obsessed with results."[Show relevant experience/credentials instead of fake numbers]
Files: app/page.tsx
Phase 5: Make Guarantees Specific & Believable
Current guarantees feel vague. Make them concrete:
Current	Better
"14-Day Launch: Late? We pay YOU €100/day"	Keep — this is specific and good
"Performance: Under 80 PageSpeed? Fixed free."	"Speed: If your site loads slower than 3 seconds, we fix it free."
"Conversion Safety Net: No leads in 30 days? We rewrite free."	"Results: No inquiries in 30 days? We revise until you get them — free."
"30-Day Exit: Cancel within 30 days. Keep the website."	Keep — this is clear
Add specificity to "lead" definition:
"Qualified lead = someone who fills out your contact form or books a call"
Files: app/page.tsx
Phase 6: Add Visual Proof That's Believable
Current: Browser mockup with placeholder
Better options:
Show a real spec project — Build one example site for a fake business (or your own)
Before/After comparison — "What most websites look like vs. what we build"
Interactive element — "Enter your website URL to see what's wrong" (advanced, maybe future)
For now: At minimum, replace the placeholder with a real-looking mockup that shows:
Clean design
Clear CTA above fold
Mobile-responsive
Fast loading indicator
Files: app/page.tsx, add actual mockup image
Phase 7: Add Authenticity Signals
Missing trust elements:
Real contact info — Add phone number or WhatsApp link
Location/Service area — "Based in [Country]. Serving local businesses across Europe."
Response time promise — "We respond within 24 hours"
Refund clarity — Be specific about what the 30-day exit means
Add to footer:
Based in [Location] · hello@landyourweb.com · +XX XXX XXX XXXXWe respond within 24 hours.
Files: app/page.tsx
Phase 8: FAQ Additions for Objections
Add these questions:
"You're a new company. How do I know you can deliver?"
"Fair question. We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee specifically because we're confident in our work. You keep the website either way. Zero risk."
"What exactly counts as a 'lead'?"
"Anyone who fills out your contact form, calls your number, or books through your website. We set up tracking so you'll know exactly where inquiries come from."
Files: app/page.tsx
Phase 9: Copy Polish — More Human, Less Marketing
Specific changes:
Hero eyebrow: "For local service businesses" → "For dentists, clinics, and local pros"
Problem section: Add more specific pain
"Your last web designer disappeared after launch"
"You're paying €50/month for hosting and getting nothing"
Remove any remaining jargon:
"Conversion-optimized" → "Built to get you clients"
"Analytics setup" → "We track where your clients come from"
Pricing: Remove value anchor if it feels salesy
Or make it specific: "Most agencies charge €3,000+ and take 2-3 months. We do it in 14 days for €1,200."
Files: app/page.tsx
Phase 10: Mobile Refinements
Ensure founder section looks good on mobile
Check that new longer copy doesn't break layouts
Verify touch targets on new elements
