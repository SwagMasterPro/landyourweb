1) Snapshot — who this avatar is

Name (for thinking): Gabriel / Maria — owner-operator of a local service business
Business type: single-location service provider (clinic, dentist, physiotherapist, local legal/financial advisor, gym, high-value trades, boutique agency)
Revenue band: small-to-medium local business (€50k–€1M annual)
Decision maker: owner / founder (age 30–55)
Tech comfort: basic — uses Facebook/Google, some have booking software; not technical but open to simple, rapid solutions that clearly increase bookings.

2) Hard market facts (load-bearing citations)

Primary marketing pain: finding new customers and measuring what works are top SMB marketing problems. 
Forbes

Romania / EU context: Romania has high internet penetration and rising digitalisation among SMEs, but many SMEs still lag in advanced digital adoption — means big upside for straightforward, measurable digital offers. 
DataReportal – Global Digital Insights

Landing page conversion baseline: expect ~6% median conversion for a good landing page (industry median); use this as a realistic target for your TikTok→LP funnel. 
Unbounce

What small businesses pay: a professionally built 5–7 page site for small business markets in Europe commonly ranges around low-to-mid thousands (research shows wide ranges; €350–€1,500 is a typical lower-mid market average but positioning and guarantees let you price higher). Use €1,200 as your front-end. 
Leadpages

Online booking impact: online booking adoption materially increases revenue and conversions for local services (companies report meaningful revenue uplifts after adding booking). Build booking/appointment flows into the conversion promise.

3) Psychographics — motivations, fears, buying triggers

Primary motivator: predictable, booked appointments / clients — not aesthetics.

Secondary motivator: less time wasted on tech; wanting a trustworthy vendor who “knows how websites make money.”

Biggest fears / objections: being scammed by agencies, paying a lot and getting no results, hidden ongoing fees, endless timelines. (Use guarantees to kill fear.)

Buying trigger events: slow months, new competitor in town, new owner, loan obligations, poor reviews, or a recent marketing campaign that failed to convert.

How they assess vendors: case proof (local), clear timeline, simple pricing, fast time-to-value.

4) Business signals that indicate fit (qualification triggers)

Existing ad spend or social presence (they already try to attract clients).

Appointments or products that convert at high ticket (≥€300 average order value) — easier to justify your price.

Frustration expressed publicly (reviews, comments, posts) about “website not working.”

Owner engages on TikTok/Facebook/Instagram or has staff who can film short videos.

5) Dollar economics & acceptable CAC (rules of thumb)

Front-end price to use: €1,000–€1,500 (we recommended €1,200). That fits market norms and recovers CAC quickly. 
Leadpages

Mandatory continuity: €150–€299/month (we use €199). This converts your business to LTV math.

Benchmark funnel math: if landing page converts at 4–8% (aim 6%), and you need 1 paid client per 20–25 calls/contacts, your CAC target for TikTok should be set so month-one margin > 0 (practical target CAC ≤ €600). Use your real numbers to validate. 
Unbounce

6) Key Metrics to track (what to monitor first 90 days)

TikTok: views / watch-through / clicks to bio

Landing page: visits → leads (conversion %) — baseline goal 4–8%. 
Unbounce

Leads → booked calls (%)

Calls → paying clients (%)

CAC per client, 30-day gross profit, MRR from maintenance

Appointment show-rate & first-month revenue uplift (if using booking system). 
Signpost

7) Messaging that works (core value propositions)

Outcome + Speed: “Live in 14 days + booked clients or we keep working free.” (Time + revenue)

Low effort for the owner: “You answer a short form; we handle everything.” (Effort ↓)

Risk reversal: 14-day launch guarantee / PageSpeed / 30-day leads safety net (use stacked guarantees).

Engineering credibility: “Built with Next.js + Tailwind — optimized for speed and Core Web Vitals.” (Technical signal to reassure business customers who equate tech with reliability.)

Economic framing: “Covers your ad CAC in month one — here’s the math.” (Show a clear ROI example.)

Use short TikTok hooks that lead with pain + time promise: e.g., “If your website didn’t bring a client this month, it’s not a website — it’s a brochure. We fix that in 14 days.”

8) TikTok content & hooks tailored to this avatar

(Use these as 15–45s scripts)

Hook type: “If you’re a [dentist/gym/clinic] in [City], listen up…”

Conversion proof: “This is how we turned 100 visits into 12 consults in 14 days — here’s the 3-section homepage that did it.”

Rapid audit format: “3 things I’d fix on your homepage in 30s” (screen-record + voiceover)

Risk killer: “Why spending €10k on a site often fails — the missing KPI is this.”

Social proof: short before → after screenshots (obscure client names) with “Bookable in 14 days” CTA

Leverage local markers: city names, “Romania” or EU references. Keep captions in English + Romanian where appropriate.

9) Landing page expectations from this avatar

Must contain (in order of attention priority):

Clear headline: benefit (clients) + timeframe (14 days)

One-sentence proof: short social proof or “we’ve launched X sites”

Simple price anchor: €1,200 + €199/mo (present as clear offer)

Use cases / who it’s for (checkbox list)

Guarantees (stack) — this kills trust objections

How it works: 3-step process (15-min call → sprint → launch)

Sticky CTA on mobile (book call / calendar)

Micro-FAQ (time needed, cancellation, SEO, who it isn’t for)

Technical strip (small, tasteful line: “Built with Next.js • PageSpeed optimised • Hosting included”) — shows engineering excellence.

10) Objection handling — short scripts you can use (DM / call / TikTok reply)

“It’s too expensive” → “Most clients make the setup back in month one from 1–2 new customers; we can model this for your business in the call.”

“We already have a website” → “Great — in the 15-minute call we’ll audit and tell you whether to rebuild or improve — no pressure.”

“We had an agency and it failed” → “Tell me the results you saw. We don’t sell deliverables — we sell booked clients. If we don’t deliver the agreed number of leads, we work free until we do.”

11) Sales qualification checklist (15-minute call)

Ask and qualify quickly; disqualify to save time:

Are you the decision maker? (Yes → continue)

Do you currently take bookings/appointments? (Yes → good)

What’s your monthly marketing budget (ads, SEO)? (If zero and unwilling → disqualify)

What is the average value of a new client? (If <€100, re-evaluate pricing or target niche)

What are your current monthly leads & bookings?

Expectation match: “We can launch in 14 days; are you ready to commit to a 3-month maintenance plan?” (If no → disqualify)

12) Onboarding & delivery expectations (what to promise)

Intake form (10 min) + 2 short videos/images from owner (if available)

Vetted content & copy provided as default — owner edits once

Week 1: build MVP → Week 2: revisions → Day 14: live + analytics + booking flow

Monthly report + 30-day conversion check → homepage rewrite if no leads (per guarantee). 
Signpost

13) Tactical 30/60/90-day plan (execution)

Day 0–7: Launch hero TikTok content + LP (focused funnel). Track clicks.
Day 8–30: Optimize landing page headlines, CTA copy, 2–3 video formats; respond to DMs; book calls.
Days 31–60: Close first clients, implement maintenance, run testimonial videos and case-studies.
Days 61–90: Scale posting cadence, A/B test CTA/button copy and offer anchors, create referral triggers.

Benchmark goals by day 30: 5–10 qualified calls, 1–3 signed clients (depends on posting frequency & market).

14) Practical messaging bank (10 micro-hooks to use)

“If your website didn’t get a client this month, it’s not a website — it’s decoration.”

“We launch lead-ready sites in 14 days. Here’s the proof.”

“Most agencies sell design. We sell booked clients.”

“Why your homepage is silently killing bookings.”

“How to know if your website is costing you €X/month.”

“Stop paying for redesigns. Start paying for leads.”

“We don’t take long scopes — we ship a converting site fast.”

“Here’s the 3-section homepage that actually converts.”

“Want bookable clients? Book a 15-min call — we’ll show you the math.”

“Built with Next.js for speed. Built for bookings.”

15) Quick risks & mitigations

Risk: Low-quality leads from TikTok. → Mitigation: strong pre-qualifier (bio + short intake form), DM triage, qualification questions on call.

Risk: Overpromising to close. → Mitigation: Keep guarantees measurable and enforceable; don’t promise unrealistic lead volumes without data.

Risk: Delivery quality slips under scale. → Mitigation: Standardize the productized sprint and SOPs (ClickUp templates, templates for copy/layout).

Final micro-plan (immediately actionable)

Use the landing page copy we built. Add a small “technical strip” under hero: “Next.js • Tailwind • PageSpeed optimised” (credibility).

Post 1 TikTok/day for 30 days from the content calendar; prioritize problem → mechanism → offer format.

Track these KPIs first: visits → lead rate (aim 4–8%) → calls booked → clients. Adjust CAC target to keep month-one gross profit positive.
